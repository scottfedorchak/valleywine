    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div id="faq_list">

      <ol>
        <li> Q: How do I take an idea for a wine label and turn this into a finished product?</li>

        <li>Q: We have mature vineyards and a respectable amount of capital to invest, so how do we start a winery?</li>

        <li>Q: Over the past several years we have been making a few thousand cases of our wine, but with no real plan
          for marketing our brand and now have excess inventories on-hand. What can we do in the short-term to reduce
          inventories of finished goods and also look to increasing distribution and sales in the future?
        </li>

        <li>Q: Without actually building our own winery, is it possible to create a label and produce wines to sell
          under this brand name?
        </li>

        <li>Q: Since we do not own a winery, where can we crush our grapes and then age and bottle the wines? How much
          will this cost?
        </li>

        <li>Q: We receive frequent compliments on our familyâ€™s wines, but many people have suggested that our packaging
          could use a little (or a lot) of help! How do we find the right designer to give our brand a much-needed boost
          in consumer appeal and sales?
        </li>

        <li>Q: With limited resources or time for extensive travel, are there ways of marketing my wines other than
          through the traditional distributor network?
        </li>
