    <h1>Welcome to Valley Wine Works</h1>
    <h2>Wine Industry Consulting Services</h2>

      <%= image_tag("../../../images/wine-glass-bottle-table-smaller.jpg") %><p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p class="main_content">At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

      <p class="main_content>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.By definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.  We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p class="main_content>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>
