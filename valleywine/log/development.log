      <p>At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

        industry.</p>

      <p>The challenges are many and very dynamic, with more than ample opportunity to either establish a well-run,
        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

    <div id="home_text">

      <p>At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

      <p>The challenges are many and very dynamic, with more than ample opportunity to either establish a well-run,
        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

      <p>The challenges are many and very dynamic, with more than ample opportunity to either establish a well-run,
        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

      <p>The challenges are many and very dynamic, with more than ample opportunity to either establish a well-run,
        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

      <p>The challenges are many and very dynamic, with more than ample opportunity to either establish a well-run,
        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

      <p>The challenges are many and very dynamic, with more than ample opportunity to either establish a well-run,
        profitable operation or err in some significant way, potentially damaging a winery and its respective products
        over the long-term.</p>

      <p>We will explore the client winery’s goals, logistics, infrastructure and available resources, in developing
        strategic plans aimed at maximizing efficiencies, brand positioning and ultimately profitability.</p>

      <p>Most new businesses begin as an inspiration, often driven by opportunity and frequently simple passion. For
        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>We will bring your winery’s founding members together to explore the genesis, goals and expectations for their
        new company. Every facet of this highly complex industry will be reviewed during this process.</p>

      <p>A comprehensive business plan will be prepared and presented to the appropriate leadership of the winery, with
        critical success factors emphasized and an action plan agreed upon.</p>


      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.</p>

      <p>By simplified definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.</p>

      <p>Valley Wine Works will interview the management team to determine a brand’s desired role within the many
        premium wines categories/tiers (varietal, origin, price, etc.) and create a strategic positioning for the
        product. We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.By definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.  We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.By definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.  We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.By definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.  We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>

        this reason, many new wineries are built and brands launched because the founders have access to wine grapes
        and/or out of pure love for the pleasures of wine and the lifestyle associated with it. However, this can also
        be the beginning of an unfamiliar and often frustrating journey for many.</p>

      <p>At Valley Wine Works we work with concept or existing wineries and their respective principals, management and
        workforce to establish well conceived business plans and to consider every facet of today’s very complex wine
        industry.</p>

      <p>Many people think of marketing and sales as being synonymous terms. Related yes, but very different disciplines
        with individual needs.By definition, marketing explores the opportunities and works to create demand. Sales acts to place
        the item(s) into the chosen channels accessible to consumers, who it is hoped, will be compelled to a purchase
        decision (conversion), and based on the efforts and message of marketing.  We will also suggest key marketing tools, critical to creating trade and consumer awareness and
        demand.</p>

      <p>We will also offer direction on tapping into the many channels for distribution of a product, as well as
        wholesale and retail opportunities, both on premise (restaurants, hotels) and retail (independent and chain
        grocery and drug stores). We will also consider the lesser-known and emerging means of executing a wine product,
        such as the internet, direct-to-consumer, wine clubs, etc.</p>
